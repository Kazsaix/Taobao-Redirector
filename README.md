Taobao Redirector
=========================
A simple chrome extension that redirects mobile and world taobao links to desktop links

A huge thanks to Will (/u/ugwu123) for creating the logic behind converting to desktop links
All I really did was package his website taobaotools.github.io into an extension

## Install Chrome
Chrome Store links will come soon, once extension doesn't break site functionality when purchasing 
1. In Chrome, open chrome://extensions/
2. Click + Developer mode
3. Click Load unpacked extension…
4. Navigate to the extension’s folder and click OK
5. (Optional) Delete the (extracted) folder (the extension was copied) 

## Todo
1. Improve logic for ignoring sites
	1.1 Maybe only change certain formats of links that corresponds to item/shop
2. Make better logo
3. Options popup
4. Maybe off/on button
5. redirect world switch?
